            <p>I wish to expand my knowledge of programming, whilst keeping a balance of other things that I find fun. I go to the gym, study Vietnamese (currently at a beginner level) and I love to travel.
                Please come back to this section as I am always updating my personality! Thank you for reading.

                    Here are some of my favourite albums. My music taste is quite open as I can listen to pretty much anything and I'll be happy.
                    I mostly listen to edm with some kpop, emo and rock mixed in. My childhood started with Linkin Park but they have always stuck with me, so
                    I consider them my favourite band!
                    <BR><BR>
                    I also have an addiction to lo-fi music, which has been the sole reason
                    for me passing all uni classes. The artist Purrple Cat has been my saving grace this year. Definitely give them a listen if you like lo-fi or need
                    some study motivation.

                    I never have enough time to watch tv so trying to decide my favourite series from
                    the small number of shows I've watched is easy. My recent top 3 series would have to be 'Arcane'... actually that's all I have watched recently.
                    <BR><BR>
                    I am a big anime fan so maybe that's where most of my time goes. 
                    I love slice-of-life, romance and fantasy anime, such as 'Koboyashi's Dragon Maid', 'Mirai Nikki' and 'Rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai'.
                    However, I can probably enjoy any genre of anime as long as it's not horror -_-
                    <BR><BR>
                    It's a similar situation for movies, like series, I don't regularly sit down to watch movies. It's more of a spontaneous feeling that I'll see a movie plot
                    online and need to watch it. My favourite movies of all time are 'Gladiator' and 'Coraline'.

                    As stated above I have a passion for travelling. I have lived in Scotland my whole life and obviously that can be a bit dull at times, 
                    especially with the terrible weather we have here. Unfortunately I haven't actually had the luxury to travel much, 
                    so hopefully from now on that'll change!
                    <BR><BR>
                    This year I was fortunate enough to travel to Vietnam for 2 weeks during summer break. It was a totally different experience to Scotland, 
                    and it really opened my eyes being introduced to a new culture all at once. The weather, food, and culture as a whole was way better than anything I have at home. 
                    I loved every second of my trip and hope to go back soon. I have attached some photos below of some highlights from the trip!
