        <p>This game was written in pure java back in 2021. It was an attempt to teach myself GUI as well as some Game Engine basics, such as game loop,
            render stages and collision. It was also my first java program that didn't rely on the built in console. It worked well as a learning tool
            and in my opinion came out well as a final game. Obviously the design is very basic, but the idea worked well and the game executes smoothly.

        <p>I was very naive when creating this project. I decided that I would do the whole project using only my brain and no help from the internet.
            As it was my first game this surprisingly worked well for a while, until bugs appeared one after another. I had a few issues with screen boundary collision.
            Firstly the player could move the cursor outside of the play area, completely avoiding all the enemies!
            Afterwards I realised moving the game window would not move all the game objects with it, they stayed relative to the screen and would disappear from view.

        </p>
        <p>Apart from these 2 main bugs every other issue was the usual missing semi-colon or me writing the wrong variable name.
            This project taught me many things. Along with the code experience I learned that even though it's cool to be able create games in raw java,
            I don't want to do it again. Knowing when to use the internet was also a big learning experience.
